    <h2><br>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><br>Steps</h2>
    <ol >
        <li>            
            Beat eggs in a bowl with an electric mixer until thick and 
            lemon-colored, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Stir in milk inside the previous mixture.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Sift together flour, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl. 
            Add to egg mixture; mix until batter is smooth.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Grease a griddle with butter; heat over medium heat. Drop 
            tablespoonfuls of batter on the griddle; spread to make thin 
            pancakes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cook until light brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minute
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Flip and continue cooking until second side is light brown,
