    <h1>Swedish Glögg</h1>

    <img src="../images/glogg_photo" >
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Glogg</em> is warm served during the <em>Christmas holidays</em> in Sweden and other 
        Scandinavian countries, as it is sweet, spicy, and warming. 
        This is the adult version of the drink, so <em>don't serve it to the kids!</em> 
        Garnish drinks with raisins and slivered almonds. 
        Serve warm with gingerbread cookies.
    </p>

    <h2><br>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (750 milliliter) bottles fruity red wine, such as Beaujolais</li>
        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle port wine</li>
        <li>3 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>14 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 orange, peel cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>¾ cup rum, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup brandy, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 cup slivered almonds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><br>Steps</h2>
    <ol >
        <li>            
            Gently simmer the red wine, port wine, cinnamon sticks, 
            whole cloves, and orange peel in a large pot set over medium-low heat.
             Stir in the sugar, rum, and brandy. Continue simmering 5 minutes more,
              stirring to completely dissolve the sugar, and the mixture is 
              steaming but not boiling.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Mix the raisins and almonds together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            To serve, ladle into coffee cups or Swedish-style small glass or 
            ceramic mugs. Garnish each cup with a spoonful of the raisin and 
            almond mixture.
        </li>
    </ol>
