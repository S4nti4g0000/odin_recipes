    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A rich and creamy Swedish meatball sauce makes a comforting meal when served 
        over pre-cooked meatballs. This quick and easy recipe makes a generous amount 
        of sauce for 10 ounces of frozen meatballs. Serve over egg noodles or rice.
    </p>

    <h2><br>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce/li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed, or more to taste</li>
        <li>10 ounces frozen cooked meatballs, thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><br>Steps</h2>
    <ol >
        <li>            
            Whisk together stock, cream, flour, soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 
            and 1/2 teaspoon rosemary in a large saucepan over low heat until 
            smooth.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Stir in thawed meatballs, and continue cooking until meatballs are 
            heated through, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center of the meatballs should read at least 160 
            degrees F (71 degrees C).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
